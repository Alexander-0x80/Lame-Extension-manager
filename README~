This is my first try with Gnome-Shell extensions and Gjs . 
As there are no Doc's it was written by rtfs! :) Some sources are better than others .
Also i found that there is no GUI tool for extensions management , sure there is gnome-tweak-tool
but not everybody likes to use it olny for enabling \ disabling extensions . Anyway i wanted some 
tool with nice GUI and as i have no JavaScript experience i decided that it's about time to learn .
Writing a Gjs extension was the first thing that came to my mind . 

So after about 6 days of casual coding it works , simple extension manager , you can Enable/Disable installed extensions from it .
i'm pretty sure it's buggy , but works nice on my system for now :)
